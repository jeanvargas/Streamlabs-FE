This assignment did take about 4 hours to complete, and I felt it had an appropriate level of difficulty. For me, the most challenging part of the assignment was calculating when an image was being dragged outside of the canvas. It was not clear what should be done when the canvas is resized and the image coordinates fall outside of the canvas borders. I decided to change the coordinates of an images if the resized canvas would cause them to be outside of the canvas.
I decided to build the project only using "vanilla" javascript. I considered converting it to a React app after the first version, but I decided I would still be able to implement future requirements using plain javascript and I wanted to keep the app small.
